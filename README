TODO:
- Introduce amplitude modulation constant on synthesizer
- Use two ventricle volume curves (for each side), modulated oppositely and weight averaged according to relative ventricular volumes
- Remove spontaneous option
- Derive flow only after expansion of volumes
- Use vessel branches (number and dimensions) from Singhal et al. (1973) instead of segments and elements from Strahler
- Use better heart with two atria and two ventricles
- Use aorta and pulmonary artery as vertical vessels
- Add quasi-static venous volumes in arterial tree
